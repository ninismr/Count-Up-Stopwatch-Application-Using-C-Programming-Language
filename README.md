# Count-Up/Stopwatch Application Using C# Programming Language

##### This is a project of the Computing Career and Programming course. This project aims to do a count-up or I can say this is a simple stopwatch application with a form of 'HH:MM:SS.sss' created using C# programming language and also the user can control or use the application using 3 buttons which are 'start' used to start the application, 'pause' used to pause the application, and 'reset' used to reset the application back to its initial settings.
